I have decided to start my own blog. This is the first post of hopefully many more to come.

Since day one of my development career, I have been thinking about how cool it would be to have my own blog. For the longest time, I thought that as a beginner and bootcamp graduate, I did not have the knowledge to write interesting content that members of the community would be interested in.

Today, I believe that every person in tech – regardless of their career level and knowledge – is gaining experiences along the way that are worth sharing.

I am looking forward to share my experiences on this blog and ramble on technologies that I enjoy.
