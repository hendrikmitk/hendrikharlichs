# Hi, I am Hendrik Harlichs.

I am a **Software Developer** living in Hamburg, Germany. I currently work at <a href="https://jobs.check24.de/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">CHECK24</a> where I am mainly dealing with the ins and outs of Angular, TypeScript and PHP. I build stuff on the web using both established and cutting-edge technologies, however, I have a soft spot for the front-end.

I have been a project manager, product owner, online editor, and even a car mechanic, but solving real-world problems while building useful, value-added web applications is what I enjoy the most!

I graduated from the Full-Stack Web Development program at the <a href="https://hamburgcodingschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Hamburg Coding School</a> and consider myself a life-long learner. On my <a href="/notes">blog</a> I share my experiences and deal with tech topics.
