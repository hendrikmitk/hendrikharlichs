# Hi, I am Hendrik Harlichs.

I am a **Software Developer** from Hamburg, Germany, currently working at <a href="https://www.awork.com/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">awork</a> as a Full-Stack Growth Engineer. Together with my team, I focus on increasing user conversion, engagement, and retention by building thoughtful features and experiments within a modern Angular application.

I have been a project manager, product owner, online editor, and even a car mechanic, but solving real-world problems while building useful, value-added web applications is what I enjoy the most!

I graduated from the Full-Stack Web Development program at the <a href="https://hamburgcodingschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Hamburg Coding School</a> and consider myself a life-long learner. On my <a href="/notes">blog</a> I share my experiences and deal with tech topics.
